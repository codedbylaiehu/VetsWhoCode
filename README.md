# Vets Who Code

## Modules

### HTML and CSS
#### Setting Up HQ
> Setting up was a challenge because I have used vs code and git before, however I am no git pro yet and cloning / pushing changes to my pre-existing main was an exercise in memory and research. 

#### Styling The Web
### Javascript
#### Preparing My Toolkit
> For this exercise I'm choosing to use nvim instead of vscode because I enjoy the CLI environment more. There is a general lack of creature comforts but there are also less distraction. 
#### My First Javascript Code 
```
<script>
      function showMessage() {
        document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "HELLO, WORLD!";
      }
    </script>
```
